 *  A string or set of strings tuned to the same note (sometimes octaves above/below each other)
 *  e.g. a Mandolin has 4 "courses" (a 12-string guitar has 6 courses)
 *  Technically, a single string is also a course, so a 6-string guitar also has 6 courses.
 *  Some instruments have some courses that are pairs or triplets of strings AND some courses that are single strings.
