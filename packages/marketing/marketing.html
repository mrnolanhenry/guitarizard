          <br><br>Don't know the name? Find any key by some of the notes you're playing,
          <br>e.g. 'A, B, C#, D, F, Gb.'

        <h3>Equivalent Keys</h3>
        <p>
          Let's say you're playing notes that fit in 'E major,' but you feel like the root is in 'Db.'
          <br>If you know your theory, you might know that you're actually playing in 'Db aeolian.'
          <br><br>What about if you're playing notes that seem to fit in 'E dorian #4?'
          <br><br>Guitarizard will let you know you're looking for 'Db locrian 6.'
