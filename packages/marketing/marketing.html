        <h3>Searching for Keys</h3>
        <p>
          Quickly find a key by searching for its name, e.g. 'C# mixolydian' or
          just 'mixolydian'
          <br /><br />Don't know the name? Find any key by some of the notes
          you're playing, <br />e.g. 'A, B, C#, D, F, Gb.'

        <h3>Equivalent Keys</h3>
        <p>
          Let's say you're playing notes that fit in 'E major,' but you feel
          like the root is in 'Db.'
          <br />If you know your theory, you might know that you're actually
          playing in 'Db aeolian.' <br /><br />What about if you're playing
          notes that seem to fit in 'E dorian #4?' <br /><br />Guitarizard will
          let you know you're looking for 'Db locrian 6.'
